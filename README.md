# clique-app

Clique is an online community platform for women to openly feel safe in discussing their life struggles with other women. 
The purpose is for all women on the community to receive and give support to one another during times of hardship. 
A user can log in/register and immediately see a list of communities available that they can join such as "relationships" or "mental health".
Join a community that relates to your current issues and write a post, comment on a post and individually message another user to connect!

Web App fully built with REACT and using sequelize. 
Deployed to Heroku.
