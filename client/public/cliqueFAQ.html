                Community Guidelines:
                
                This place is built on Girlboss’s own internal value system—this is important because it’s what we stand for and commit to both internally and externally:
                Humor: We take our work seriously, but we don’t take ourselves seriously.
                Resourcefulness: We do more with less, but raise our hands when we need help.
                Vulnerability: We have real conversations about where we are and what we need to succeed—and are comfortable with change.
                Curiosity: We are eternal learners, ask dumb questions (but never treat others’ ideas or Q’s as dumb) and are comfortable trying and failing.
                Inclusivity: We value diversity of age, race, gender, religion, ability, experience, class, size, and more.
                Here’s the essential takeaway: Always show respect to others so that we can continue to enjoy good vibes in the Girlboss community. More details here.
